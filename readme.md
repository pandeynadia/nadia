# Usability Friendliness of Gaming and Music Applications

## DH 150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Nadia Pandey

## App #1: Magic Piano Tiles 4: Pop Songs

### Motivation: 
My motivation for picking this gaming app is that I am passionate about simple games on phone, which a user can play to pass time or for fun. In many ways, games can be therapeutic for the gamer. However, a game that is not user friendly can instead frustrate the player and ruin the reputation that game. I picked this game in particular is because it was a very fun game for me to play once I got used to it and learned its methods and controls through trial and error, but in the beginning this game frustrated me because it is not user friendly for new gamers. I believe changing and fixing a few features in this app could make this game not only fun but addicting.

### Overall evaluation:

The game is simple: the user clicks rectangular boxes consistently while music plays while the speed of the boxes gets faster with time. Overall, the game is very fun to play ones the user acquires the skills to play the game but due to the lack of direction or help tools, the game is only intended for expert phone gamers. The game also freezes a lot and at times, the music while playing the game pauses for unknown reasons. Even though the game is fun to play, the unknown variables makes this game incredibly frustrating. If the game could add “how to play” or “help” features, the user would feel less need to be frustrated. The color scheme of the game is also not color-blind, which limits audiences. Another feature that could be added is the display button of the number of level and a pause button in case the user gets interrupted while playing the game. Also, a “Save” button would be helpful so the user can return to the game at a later time without losing progress. Regardless, the game is very fixable, and the overall idea of the game is very entertaining as clicking on the dark blue rectangular boxes is entertaining.

## Heuristics evaluation for App #1:

## 1.	Visibility of system status

•	Communication of system status is not present. For example, when the user plays the game, there is no indicator of life. (Severity rating: 2).

•	There is no feedback after the user has finished playing the game. How does the player know how well they did on each level? There is only an ad pop up. (Severity rating: 1).

•	There is no indicator of when the game starts or any “how to play” manual for the user. The game simply begins, and the user is left to figure out the game. (Severity rating: 2).

•	There is no pause display. What if the user is doing well on the game, but has to pause? They simply have to start the game all over again, which can be frustrating. This also violates Usability Heuristic #2 as real-world problems come up unpredictably and the user cannot always finish the game without pausing. (Severity rating: 3).

•	There is no progress indicator. Although I like the game, the game loses its meaning without a point-based system or a progress tracking device such as a bar. (Severity rating: 2).

•	There is no indicator for how long each level is or how many levels the game has. This also makes the game lose its meaning for users who play games for competitive reasons and want to beat all the levels.  (Severity rating: 2).

•	The only indicators in the game are the 3 stars and 3 crowns at the top. However, sometime, this feature does not work and there is again no manual for what the 3 stars or crowns mean. (Severity rating: 3).

## 2.	Match between system and the real world

•	The app has some unfamiliar interface. For example, the star and crown symbol mentioned above makes it unclear if the stars are better than the crowns, or if they are the same. Are there special points earned if one gets a star vs. a crown? These are the types of questions the user is left to wonder on their own. (Severity rating: 3).

•	As soon as I open the game, a screen appears with a “Buy it” button and under it another button that says, “I get it.” I would remove “I get it” because it is quite annoying to the user and it does not make it clear what “I get it” refers to. I would also not have this screen as the first thing that appears because it makes the user believe that he or she may not be able to play the game without buying it first, which is misleading. (Severity rating: 2).

•	There is no “Help” menu. The user is left to fend for themselves in the game without any knowledge of how to play the game. (Severity rating: 3).

## 3.	User control and freedom

•	There is no way to exit the game. (Severity rating: 3)

•	There is no way to pause the game. (Severity rating: 3)

•	There is no way to share the game or the score. (Severity rating: 3)

## 4.	Consistency and standards

•	There is an internal consistency of tapping each rectangle to get the points, however, the game only gives the user a four second screen which tells the user to “tap the box as it approaches the line to get a ‘perfect’ rating.” What if the user can’t read fast and he or she is a new gamer and who does not know about tapping the rectangular buttons on the screen? In this way, the game frustrates the user as they have to spend time and effort to learn how to perform actions if they are not a fast reader. The game also assumes that the users have a prior knowledge of how to play the game. The word “rating” is also confusing so I would change this word to “score” instead as more people know what scores mean in a game than “rating.” (Severity rating: 3).

## 5.	Error prevention

•	As previously mentioned, sometimes, the game freezes. However, there are no “get help” button. This button could help with any error the game designers overlooked in order to improve the game and the user experience. (Severity rating: 3).

## 6.	Recognition rather than recall

•	The game does a good job of minimizing the player’s cognitive load by reducing the amount of controls for the user. For example, the game lets the user tap of each rectangular boxes—one that makes them loose, the one that makes them win. However, the lack of clarity of which box to tap makes the game confusing. Once the player picks the box with a line, the user sees that they need to keep picking the strings in order to win. This makes the game one that requires recall rather than recognition, making the game less natural. (Severity rating: 2).

## 7.	Flexibility and efficiency of use

•	Since there is no “how to play” button or manual, the game is only efficient for expert gamers and not a beginner, who would have to take extra time to play the game and learn it only through trial and error.  (Severity rating: 2).

•	The instructions to “tap the box” is pretty easy but because it displays only for 4 seconds before the game starts, the instruction is easy to miss. (Severity rating: 2).

•	Only one person can play the game and there is no way for two people to play. A “switch user” button would be effective as it would let the gamers switch turns and compete for higher scores. (Severity rating: 2).

•	There is only a limited list of songs to hear while playing the game. Having the freedom to choose songs can make the game more entertaining. (Severity rating: 1).

## 8.	Aesthetic and minimalist design

•	The light blue and purple background of the game is aesthetically pleasing, but the game does not use a color-blind pallet, which means that the color scheme could be confusing to the color-blind individuals. (Severity rating: 3).

## 9.	Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

•	There is no error message in the game even though the game frequently freezes. The user is left to close the game and restart the game. (Severity rating: 3).

•	The game should use simple language to diagnose frequent problems such as freezing of the game and have a “report this” button in order to not mark the game simply as a defective product that the creator does not care about. (Severity rating: 3).

•	There is no “back” button if the user accidently begins the game. Also, since music play which the game is being played, there is no “mute” button. What if the user is in a public setting and cannot play loud music? (Severity rating: 3).

## 10.	Help and documentation

•	Again, there is no “help,” “tour” “search” or “how to play” button. I would make at least one of these features available at every interface. (Severity rating: 3).

•	An “FAQ” page and a chat box would help users not only get answers to most commonly asked questions, but it would create a community where other users can ask each other questions and give answers, which could make the game more popular. (Severity rating: 2).

## App #2: Video Mate: Music Playlist & TubeMate Audio Player

### Motivation: 
My motivation for picking this music app is that I like the idea of having a free app where I can listen to or browse songs without subscribing or paying for it. As a student who is on a tight budget, I understand the need for others like me to find a way to enjoy music without financial burdens. I want to find a way to make music accessible and effortless for individuals. Moreover, because this app offers music videos, the user has a choice of only listening to the music or watching the music video as they play their favorite songs.

### Screenshots: 

### Overall evaluation:

This app caught my attention with its cost-free feature and its categorized section where I can choose which type of music I want to listen to, such as, action, adventure, animation etc. However, this app quickly disappointed me by not letting me pick my own songs and freezing the screen often with “network error” message. There is also no help button and the “top 100” music page is outdated to early 2010 songs. There is no music on the “popular” page nor any instructions on adding music. There is also no way to create a playlist. Therefore, the app could be fixed and user friendly by having a “help” “add music” and an updated selection of music on every interface. 

## Heuristics evaluation for App #2:

## 1.	Visibility of system status

•	Selecting a song takes only a couple seconds, but it does not let me see a progress bar, which means that I cannot see when it will be complete. (Severity rating: 1).

•	More than half of the time of using the app, error message appears without a way for resolution, which means that the upload process for music has more than fifty percent change of failing. For this reason, I would add a “Report” button, which will allow me to report the system failure to the creator so that they are aware of the frequent bugs and can find a solution. (Severity rating: 3).

## 2.	Match between system and the real world

•	The app is great at using concepts like “Playlists,” “Genres,” and “Popular” as these are very familiar with real world systems. However, these features cannot be used offline and freezes without a strong WI-FI connections, which can be unrealistic as many people do not always have access to a strong Wi-Fi on-the-go. The app’s inability to efficiently play songs offline also means that it cannot be used while a user is walking, running, on the bus or in the car, which makes this app inefficient when it comes its adaptability to real world circumstances. (Severity rating: 3).

•	The app can only be added to “My Playlist” after clicking on the heart symbol. However, this makes the app very confusing as a lot of the time, clicking the heart symbol only favorites the songs instead of putting it on a playlist, which makes this feature counterintuitive. (Severity rating: 2).

## 3.	User control and freedom

•	The app does a good job at putting the user in charge of the app for the most part by letting them pick their own songs, like their favorite music. However, the app does not feature recent songs even though it states it on the description and the search logo of the app can be misleading as some songs do no display or play. Instead, a “Network error” pops up. (Severity rating: 2).

•	There is also no “back” or “undo” button in case user wants to go back and change their mind. Instead, there is a “done” button, which only works after the song loads and starts playing, wasting the user’s time. (Severity rating: 2).

## 4.	Consistency and standards

•	The app does a consistent job of having the different menus on the bottom of the page, which is similar to other popular music apps such as apple music. The app also uses a magnifier icon to signify a search feature on the bottom left corner of the app. In the search menu, there is also another magnifier icon in order to clarify that the user can press it to find other songs. Unfortunately, because the search icon does not display many songs, it is very misleading to the user. (Severity rating: 1).

•	A music app standard that’s missing from the app is the alphabetical order of songs. For example, songs with “L” titles such as “lovely” appears before songs with “H” titles such as “Hall of Fame.” This makes it counterintuitive and is opposite of a lot of other popular and well-known music apps such as apple music or Spotify because most songs are expected to be alphabetized. This confuses the user and makes it time consuming to find songs as they have to look through each song. (Severity rating: 2).

## 5.	Error prevention

•	There is no way for the creator to detect if the user may have committed an error because when an error occurs, it only gives an “ok” button for the user to click. This prevents the user from reporting the error or pointing out an efficient way to clear the error to the user. This makes the app very frustrating. (Severity rating: 3).

•	Some time, the playlist resets itself for unknown reasons and the user has to re-save their favorite songs. This is time consuming and makes the app unsatisfying. (Severity rating: 3).

## 6.	Recognition rather than recall

•	The search button does not have a scroll down button with suggested songs once the user starts typing the name of a favorite songs. What happens if the user can only partially remember the name of the songs or forgets the artist’s name? The user is left to recall the full name of the artist and the name of the song instead of recognizing familiar songs from suggested songs like when typing in partial titles. (Severity rating: 3).

•	The search bar also does not display any songs that the user may like according to the songs that they have liked in the past. The user may get bored by playing same songs and may want suggestions. (Severity rating: 1).

•	Even though the app has many diverse categories of songs, many of them are empty, which makes having the categories meaningless. For example, the “comedy” category is empty. The app should omit the empty categories in order to not get the user’s hopes up that it contains a song from a category it does not. (Severity rating: 3).

## 7.	Flexibility and efficiency of use

•	As previously discussed, the app is not flexible because the app does not let the user chose their own songs. The app also does not alphabetize their songs which makes it disorganized and inefficient. (Severity rating: 3).

•	The app does not let the user play songs when it not connected to a strong Wi-Fi signal, which further makes the app inflexible. (Severity rating: 3).

•	This app is very inefficient for new users as the user needs to familiar with the songs on the app. Otherwise, the user is left to spend a lot of extra free time trying to scroll down songs and at times re-favorite songs that somehow get deleted. A “Save the Playlist to my phone” button would solve half of this issue. (Severity rating: 3).

## 8.	Aesthetic and minimalist design

•	The app is good in being a minimalist design and everything presented is only what is necessary and useful. The app goes straight to the point and the menus are not difficult to figure out. But, the app fails to highlight many other features such as “back,” “Help,” “FAQ” buttons, all of which could help the user find solutions when they are confused or come across an error message. (Severity rating: 3).

•	The background design is also not distracting. However, there is no color-blind pallet which makes it less accessible to some users who are color-blind. (Severity rating: 3).

## 9.	Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

•	There is no way for the user to recover from errors. As previously mentioned, the app only displays “okay” when it creates an error message, which leaves the user helpless. (Severity rating: 3).

•	Due to the lack of “Report error” button, the error may never be fixed by the creator as they may be unaware of the bugs. This leaves the user hopeless and uninterested in the app. (Severity rating: 3).

•	There are random error messages stating “Network error” even when the app is working, which confuses the user because they are left to wonder if they did anything wrong and it again leaves them without a solution. (Severity rating: 3).

 ## 10.	Help and documentation

•	There are no instructions or help menu, which makes it inaccessible. As previously stated, “FAQ” page or open public forums could help create a community, and document errors for others to solve the problem if the creator is unable. (Severity rating: 3).

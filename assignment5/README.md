# Project design challenge + target user:

Main activity for this project is to see what makes the user download specific apps and what they look for while playing it so that I can build a game app for games that speaks to the games needs and desires. The basic need involved for this activity is a phone, a comfortable living room space of the user so that they feel relaxed while playing the game and a phone where they can download the game. Traditionally, gamers have had to play a video game on devices such as Xbox or other similar devices where they are stuck in once place and do not have as much mobility due to the wires. With digital technology, they are able to play similar games to those on Xbox right on their phone. This means that they are no longer restricted on where to sit, but they have more mobility. The user must be from a game community. I prefer the user to have certain knowledge that would make them understand what they like or do not like in a game so that we understand what a game that speakers to the users’ needs looks like. The user would do the activity in their living room where they are comfortable and are able to play the game without being nervous or second guessing. Doing this activity in the living room will also tell us how a user is using a product in their own environment. The user will go to the application store where they will pick and download games they like on the phone that is provided to them. When I say phrases such as “show up,” or “tell me about,” the user will play the “Master” role and inform me on the game and its usability.

#	Research methods and plan:

I plan to use the Participatory observation/ethnographic field research method where I am visiting the place where the user lives and shadowing them, interviewing them, and asking users to download a play a game they would like from the application store. Doing this will help me understand what the user likes/does not like, their verbal expressions and their facial cues. I will act as an apprentice and the user will be play the role of the master during this interaction. In doing so, I will be able to learn from the user and see realistic ways in which I could improve mobile game apps and how game apps can better fit the users’ needs, wants and instincts. I will ask the user some questions that will be in the interview guide. I will use phrases such as “show me,” or “tell me,” in order to let them guide me and not the other way around. I will also be recording the user so that I can go back and review the audio for further research. The location will be in the user’s living room so that they are comfortable, and it is in the place where the user mostly places games. I will observe the user picking a game app from the phone and he will guide me and tell me what he looks for, enjoys, likes, does not like while playing the game. I will also observe any facial distress in my notes if the user gets uncomfortable during the process. Again, this will be a face to face user interaction where the user will play the game while I observe, audio record, and learn from them user.

#	Reflection:

The interview was a face-to-face user interaction where the participant searched and played the game while I observed and learned from him. I observed the participant pick a game app from his phone and he guided me and told me what he looks for in a game and what he enjoys. He also told me what he dislikes, and I observed his facial expression, which most of the time did not seem to be in distress. I think conducting this interview in his living room really helped because it is his comfort zone where he can be himself and he usually plays games there. I believe the Contextual Inquiry went very well. I especially think that one of the most successful reason it went smoothly was because of the script prepared. There were times, however, when the participant wants to do other searches on his own. As I am the apprentice and he the “master” in this scenario, I let him do whatever he wanted as he normally would, and I observed his actions while he spoke out loud what he was thinking and doing. I was surprised to find that the participant likes mobile games that is quick to use and did not want a game that lasted long term. This means that the participant probably would not like games that has more than ten levels. One of my regrets during the interactions was that I did not ask the participant to explain to me further what he meant. For example, he said that he likes a game that does not have to do with the real-world and I wanted to know what he meant when he said “real-world.” However, since the participant kept the dialogue going (as he was thinking out loud with every process like I asked him to do), I did not want to interrupt his mental dialogue. One of the things, according to my notes, that was inconsistent with what the participant said was that he once said that he downloads new games only twice a year. Then when asked a similar question, he said that he spends twenty minutes a week searching for a new game. Another thing that was inconsistent with the participant was that he said that he likes games that are simple, but he also later said that he likes a game that is challenging. I suppose a game could be simple in its design but challenging in its game difficulty level, but I wish I had asked him to clarify it further as maybe I am jumping into conclusion. I believe that asking the same type of questions later in the interview really helped me understand how the participant can want both simple yet challenging game. Additionally, the participant said that he likes to play the game alone and also with others such as his cousins. In the future, I would like to give the participant a survey and see if I can find a way to ease the process more for him/her. Overall, I am really happy with the end result and am looking forward to using the participant’s point of view when I think about ways in which my project could be improved.

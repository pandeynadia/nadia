# Description of project:

Piano Tiles 4 is a mobile app game designed to allow users to express freedom while playing the game. This idea is especially noticeable by the game giving users the choice to either invite their friends to play with them or play a solo game. This app also lets the user save their progress and choose difficulty levels, which helps ensure that the game can be played by beginners or expert gamers. The app is also designed to give the user sovereignty over their genre of playlist so that the user can relax or accommodate their current mood while playing the game. We hope that these choices not only help the user have fun in their free time but that it also helps them connect with their friends and find harmony through its composition.

## Description of decision making of the graphical interface design:

My choice of the color scheme was made in consideration of accessibility color contrast. I went to https://contrast-ratio.com where I played around with different colors in order to make sure the score was above 8.5 at the very least. Even though I wanted the design to be fun, I wanted the screen to have a simpler theme in order to not make it cluttered. I settled with a Pink screen (HEX CODE: FFC0CB) with a blue (HEX CODE: 02075D) and black (HEX CODE: 000000)boxes. The prik and blue color had a contrast ratio score of 11.46 and the pink and the black contrast ratio was 13.65, passing the accessiblity color contrast test. Inside these blue or black boxes, I put white text (F2F2F2)for a simple look, which also had a high accessiblity score (Black and white scores 18.75 and blue and white scores 15.74). I wanted to make sure that every screen had a for users to quit or take them to the main menu (home screen) so I put a home button, and quit button on every screen. I also put saved game button on most screens in order to make it easy for the user to play their last saved game. In order to let the user have a easy transition when inviting friends, I let the user choose names of individuls they previously played with in addition to adding a feature where the user can invite new friends. I added different levels of difficulty in order to make it so that the app was beneficial for both new gamers and expert gamers. Furthermore, I added a "How to Play" instructions to help new users so that they are not lost or confused. I hope the games simple but fun design helps users easily navigate the game and gives them a way to relax, have fun and interact with friends and family.

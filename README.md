# Piano Tiles 4 Game 
## DH150 UX Design, Nadia Pandey

## Introduction: What is Piano Tiles 4?
Piano Tiles 4 is a mobile game app designed to enhance the experience of both new and experienced gamers alike. The motivation behind this project is to help game applications be easy to use for everyday users. I am passionate about simply desined phone games, which a user can play to pass time or for fun. In many ways, games can be therapeutic for gamers. However, a game that is not user friendly can instead frustrate the player and ruin the reputation of that game. 

## Design statement: 
My project focuses on user accessibility for three main features I want to improve in application. Even though this game is fun, when a game is inaccessible to users, the game can become fustrating and even uninteresting. One of the issues I found that was fustrating for me was that there was no "How to Play" the game button. It is important to resolve this issue because without a help button, the user can get too fustrated to want to play the game, which makes the game lose almost all its value. I will solve this issue by adding a "how to play" button on the homescreen and having a "Home" button on every screen, which gives them accessiblity. Another feature that the game does not have was giving the user a choice when it comes to picking their playlist while they are playing the game. Instead the game assumes what the user will like and dislike. Most individuals are picky about what genre of music they want to listen to or not. Forcing users to listen to a certain type of song that they do not like can irritate them. To fix this issue, I make a "Pick a Playlist" button that allows users to pick their genre of music. This feature will also help them play their songs while being offline since the music automatically comes with the game. Finally, many gamers want to save their progress when exiting the app. The game does not offer any "save" feature so I have not only included it to solve this issue, but I have added 5 slots to save games just in case a user gives the phone to their siblings or children to play the game. I believe changing and fixing a few features in this app could make this game not only fun but addicting.

## Competitor analysis:
### Heuristic Evaluation: 
For my evalution, I focused on two different communities: gaming and music. Even though Piano Tiles 4 has a music feature, I evaluated another app called Music Playlist & TubeMate Audio Player because it caught my attention with its cost-free feature and its categorized section where I can choose which type of music I want to listen to, such as, action, adventure, animation etc. However, just like Piano Tiles 4, this app disappointed me by not letting me pick my own songs. In the end I chose to keep Piano Tiles 4 as my project because I was more fustrated by this app and saw features that could be easily fixed, which could make this game great to play. The Piano Tiles 4 game is simple: the user clicks rectangular boxes consistently while music plays and the speed of the boxes get faster with time. Overall, the game is very fun to play ones the user acquires the skills needed to play the game, but due to the lack of direction or help tools, the game is only intended for expert gamers.

## Usablity Testing
Usability Testing (UT) can inform the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction of the product – in this case, the Magic Piano Tiles 4 application. Based on the findings of heuristic evaluation, this app seems to assume that the user has a prior knowledge of how to play the game. Therefore, it is extremely important to see what a new user would look for, what may confuse them, and what they may like as a new user. All of this information is important in order to assess what to keep or change in the app. Additionally, the app gives a brief one sentence description about how to play the game. I want to find out if a new user is able to spot the “how to play” instructions and if they find it helpful. Lastly, advertisement can be very annoying and interruptive when playing the game. I want to see if the user can spot the exit sign when an advertisement pops open and if that will distract them from the game. To test all of these, I made the survey questions with a set of instructions that guide the user step by step on how they should play the game and what features they should select in order to test the different metrics of the game. I also asked them for their satisfaction level and the difficulty in playing the game, all of which should help me understand what needs to entirely change in the application and what could be improved for a better user experience.

During the pilot test, I learned the frustrations a user can experience while using the app. As stated in the heuristic evaluation, the app seemed more suitable for expert gamers. This hypothesis was confirmed during the Usability Testing as the user had to rely on his instincts and was confused about how to play the game. The user also did not like the amount of advertisements the game forces a player to watch. While it is true that the game is free and advertisement is a way for the creators to earn income for their hard work, excessive advertisements only take away from the game as the user in this pilot testing was more than willing to exit the app and find another game. The instructions on how to play were also very hard to read as the screen automatically changes after 5 seconds or less. I believe that the game itself, once the user figured out how to play it, was entertaining, but all the poor design choices of not having a help button, save button, pause button and the excessive advertisements as previously discussed took away from the fun of the game. The pilot testing went well as the user spoke aloud every thought he had during the test. He told me what would have worked better during the test and what was helpful for him. I asked him if he had any questions about what we were doing and he asked me for clarification while conducting the test.

# Piano Tiles 4 Game 
## DH150 UX Design, Nadia Pandey

## Introduction: What is Piano Tiles 4?
Piano Tiles 4 is a mobile game app designed to enhance the experience of both new and experienced gamers alike. The motivation behind this project is to help make game applications easier to use for everyday users. I am passionate about well-designed phone games, which a user can play to pass the time or for fun. In many ways, games can be therapeutic for gamers. However, a game that is not user-friendly can instead frustrate the player and ruin the reputation of that game.

## Design statement: 
My project focuses on user accessibility for three main features I want to improve in the application. Even though this game is fun, when a game is inaccessible to users, the game can become frustrating and even uninteresting. One of the issues I found that was frustrating for me was that there was no "How to Play" the game button. It is essential to resolve this issue because, without a help button, the user can get too frustrated to want to play the game, which makes the game lose almost all its value. I will solve this issue by adding a "how to play" button on the home screen and by adding a "Home" button on every screen, which improves accessibility. Another feature that the game does not have is giving the user a choice to pick their playlist before they play. Instead, the game assumes what the user will like and dislike. Most individuals are picky about what genre of music they want to listen to or not. Forcing users to listen to a specific type of song that they do not like can irritate them. To fix this issue, I made a "Pick a Playlist" button that allows users to pick their genre of music. This feature will also help them play their songs while being offline since the music automatically comes with the game. Finally, many gamers want to save their progress when exiting the app. The game does not offer an option for the user to play with others. To solve this issue, I added an "Invite a Friend" feature, which lets users play split-screen so that they can play with their friends. I believe changing and fixing a few features in this app could make this game not only fun but addicting.

## Competitor analysis:
### Heuristic Evaluation: 
For my evaluation, I focused on two different communities: gaming and music. Even though Piano Tiles 4 has a music feature, I evaluated another app called Music Playlist & TubeMate Audio Player because it caught my attention with its cost-free feature and its categorized section where I can choose which type of music I want to listen to, such as, action, adventure, animation, etc. However, just like Piano Tiles 4, this app disappointed me by not letting me pick my songs. In the end, I chose to keep Piano Tiles 4 as my project because I was more frustrated by this app and saw features that could be easily fixed, which could make this game great to play. The Piano Tiles 4 game is simple: the user clicks rectangular boxes consistently while music plays, and the speed of the boxes gets faster with time. Overall, the game is entertaining to play once the user acquires the skills needed to play the game, but due to the lack of direction or help tools, the game is only intended for expert gamers.

## Usablity Testing
Usability Testing (UT) can inform the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the product – in this case, the Magic Piano Tiles 4 application. Based on the findings of heuristic evaluation, this app seems to assume that the user has prior knowledge of how to play the game. Therefore, it is essential to see what a new user would look for, what may confuse them, and what they may like as a new user. All of this information is important in order to assess what to keep or change in the app. Additionally, the app gives a brief one-sentence description of how to play the game. I want to find out if a new user can spot the “how to play” instructions and if they find it helpful. Lastly, the advertisement can be very annoying and interruptive when playing the game. I want to see if the user can spot the exit sign when an advertisement pops open and if that will distract them from the game. To test all of these, I made the survey questions with a set of instructions that guide the user step by step on how they should play the game and what features they should select in order to test the different metrics of the game. I also asked them for their satisfaction level and the difficulty in playing the game, all of which should help me understand what needs to change in the application entirely and what could be improved for better user experience.

During the pilot test, I learned the frustrations a user can experience while using the app. As stated in the heuristic evaluation, the app seemed more suitable for expert gamers. This hypothesis was confirmed during the Usability Testing as the user had to rely on his instincts, and was confused about how to play the game. The user also did not like the number of advertisements the game forces a player to watch. While it is true that the game is free and advertisement is a way for the creators to earn income for their hard work, excessive advertisements only take away from the game as the user in this pilot testing was more than willing to exit the app and find another game. The instructions on how to play were also tough to read as the screen automatically changes after 5 seconds or less. I believe that the game itself, once the user figured out how to play it, was entertaining, but all the poor design choices of not having a help button, save button, pause button, and the excessive advertisements as previously discussed, took away from the fun of the game. The pilot testing went well as the user spoke aloud every thought he had during the test. He told me what would have worked better during the test and what was helpful for him. I asked him if he had any questions about what we were doing and he asked me for clarification while conducting the test.

## User research [Contextual Inquiry]:
The main activity for this project is to see what makes the user download specific apps and what they look for while playing it so that I can build a game app for games that speak to the game's needs and desires. The primary need involved in this activity is a phone, a comfortable living room space of the user so that they feel relaxed while playing the game, and a phone on which they can download the game. Traditionally, gamers have had to play a video game on devices such as Xbox or other similar devices where they are stuck in once place and do not have as much mobility due to the wires. With digital technology, they can play similar games to those on Xbox right on their phone. This means that they are not restricted on where to sit, and have more mobility. The user must be from a game community. I prefer the user to have specific knowledge that would make them understand what they like or do not like in a game so that we understand what a game that speaks to the users' needs looks like. The user would do the activity in their living room where they are comfortable and are able to play the game without being nervous or second-guessing. Doing this activity in the living room will also tell us how a user is using a product in their own environment. The user will go to the application store where they will pick and download games they like on the phone that is provided to them. When I say phrases such as "show me," or "tell me about," the user will play the "Master" role and inform me on the game and its usability.

## UX Storytelling:

In order to make sure that the game is accessible to people of different backgrounds and ages, I have created three personas, each with their own scenario. The first Persona is an inexperienced gamer who wants to learn how to play a mobile game in order to connect with her teenage daughters. She needs to play a game with instructions. The second Persona is an experienced gamer who likes to play games that not only have music but allows the user to pick their genre. Therefore, it is significant for her to find a game that gives the user some freedom over the playlist. The last Persona is a gamer who is a UCLA shy teenager, looking for a way to reconnect with his high school friends. Therefore, he needs to play a game that has a two-player feature. I hope that all of these personas and scenarios help individuals find diversity within the game so that it is versatile.

## Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation:
##### Wireframes that Include Three Features:

<img width="650" alt="All3Wireframe" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59589242/76192746-cb7eca80-619f-11ea-8248-2a76e2f93b8e.png">

These initial sketches demonstrate three key app features after the user signs up (or logs in if they do not have an account) in the game. After entering their username and password, the user can go to the home screen where they can find the feature "How to Play" the game. They have the option to play the game after they are done reading the screen. The user can also choose their playlist. This gives them more freedom with their app and personalizes the game. Lastly, the user can Invite a Friend to play with them. This feature is especially helpful for college student gamers who are looking for a way to connect with other individuals but are too shy to take part in college clubs.

The purpose of this low fidelity prototype is to see if the user can interact with the game application, "PianoTiltes4" by creating a paper prototype and testing it with another individual to see if they can follow the steps with ease or if there are further errors that need to be fixed. I have put together three personas, each of which covers a feature of the game. I have written an ideal situation with a goal for each persona, their needs, context, behavior, and stories. I have also included the wireframe flow of me doing it and one of the users testing it to see if they can follow my thought process.

## High-fidelity Prototype:
Piano Tiles 4 is a mobile app game designed to allow users to express freedom while playing the game. This idea is especially noticeable by the game, giving users a choice to either invite their friends to play with them or play a solo game. This app also lets the user save their progress and choose difficulty levels, which helps ensure that beginners or expert gamers can play the game. The app is also designed to give the user sovereignty over their genre of the playlist so that the user can relax or accommodate their current mood while playing the game. We hope that these choices not only help the user have fun in their free time but that it also helps them connect with their friends and find harmony through its composition.

### What I learned and changed from the feedback:

By reflecting on the evaluation with others, I learned the different placement of the navigation menu made it confusing for the user to act quickly as he had to search around the screen to see where the main menu is. The user also pressed the quit game button when I asked him to go on the home screen. The new changes I have made to fix these issues are to move the “home” icon to the bottom of the screen along with the saved game and quit the game button. I also labeled all three of these icons in order to ensure that the user is never confused about what these buttons do. The user seemed to navigate around the menu otherwise seamlessly, and when I asked him to do the tasks (5 tasks: find how to play the game, choose a difficulty level, choose a playlist, invite friends, and save game), the user had no problem playing the game as I intended it. With the new improvements I have made to the game, I am hopeful that the user will like playing the game even more.

#### Changes After feedback:

## Conclusion: what you learned throughout the process?

This project served as one of the most valuable lessons during my college career. I not only learned how important it is to always think about the audience when creating a product, but I learned how I could begin to put myself in other people's shoes. I especially loved the Usability Testing, where I am learning through others what feature is useful or is missing when creating my app. Doing Usability Testing helped me understand some key features that I need that I would not have thought of otherwise, and it helped me learn how crucial it is to conduct testing. I also learned how to create a wireframe and wire flow, especially the high fidelity prototype. During these past ten weeks, I have learned more than I could imagine. Now I know how to create portfolios and online places where I can network or seek help when needed. I came out of this class a passionate UX Designer who will continue to build her portfolio. I am very grateful for all the lessons I have learned from this class and want to give a special thank you to professor Cho for all her effort and support while teaching this class.

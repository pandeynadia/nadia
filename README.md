My motivation for picking this gaming app is that I am passionate about simple phone games, which a user can play to pass time or for fun. In many ways, games can be therapeutic for the gamer. However, a game that is not user friendly can instead frustrate the player and ruin the reputation of that game. I picked this game in particular because it was very fun for me to play once I got used to it, learned its methods and controls through trial and error, but the beginning of this game frustrated me because it is not user friendly for new gamers. I believe changing and fixing a few features in this app could make this game not only fun but addicting. [read more....](https://github.com/pandeynadia/nadia/tree/master/assignment01)

# Piano Tiles 4 Game 
## DH150 UX Design, Nadia Pandey

## Introduction: What is Piano Tiles 4?
Piano Tiles 4 is a mobile game app designed to enhance the experience of both new and experienced gamers alike. The motivation behind this project is to help game applications be easy to use for everyday users. I am passionate about simply desined phone games, which a user can play to pass time or for fun. In many ways, games can be therapeutic for gamers. However, a game that is not user friendly can instead frustrate the player and ruin the reputation of that game. 

## Design statement: 
My project focuses on user accessibility for three main features I want to improve in application. Even though this game is fun, when a game is inaccessible to users, the game can become fustrating and even uninteresting. One of the issues I found that was fustrating for me was that there was no "How to Play" the game button. It is important to resolve this issue because without a help button, the user can get too fustrated to want to play the game, which makes the game lose almost all its value. I will solve this issue by adding a "how to play" button on the homescreen and having a "Home" button on every screen, which gives them accessiblity. Another feature that the game does not have was giving the user a choice when it comes to picking their playlist while they are playing the game. Instead the game assumes what the user will like and dislike. Most individuals are picky about what genre of music they want to listen to or not. Forcing users to listen to a certain type of song that they do not like can irritate them. To fix this issue, I make a "Pick a Playlist" button that allows users to pick their genre of music. This feature will also help them play their songs while being offline since the music automatically comes with the game. Finally, many gamers want to save their progress when exiting the app. The game does not offer any option for the user to play with others. To solve this issue, I added a "Invite a Friend" feature which lets users play split screen so that they can pay with their friends. I believe changing and fixing a few features in this app could make this game not only fun but addicting.

## Competitor analysis:
### Heuristic Evaluation: 
For my evalution, I focused on two different communities: gaming and music. Even though Piano Tiles 4 has a music feature, I evaluated another app called Music Playlist & TubeMate Audio Player because it caught my attention with its cost-free feature and its categorized section where I can choose which type of music I want to listen to, such as, action, adventure, animation etc. However, just like Piano Tiles 4, this app disappointed me by not letting me pick my own songs. In the end I chose to keep Piano Tiles 4 as my project because I was more fustrated by this app and saw features that could be easily fixed, which could make this game great to play. The Piano Tiles 4 game is simple: the user clicks rectangular boxes consistently while music plays and the speed of the boxes get faster with time. Overall, the game is very fun to play ones the user acquires the skills needed to play the game, but due to the lack of direction or help tools, the game is only intended for expert gamers.

## Usablity Testing
Usability Testing (UT) can inform the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction of the product – in this case, the Magic Piano Tiles 4 application. Based on the findings of heuristic evaluation, this app seems to assume that the user has a prior knowledge of how to play the game. Therefore, it is extremely important to see what a new user would look for, what may confuse them, and what they may like as a new user. All of this information is important in order to assess what to keep or change in the app. Additionally, the app gives a brief one sentence description about how to play the game. I want to find out if a new user is able to spot the “how to play” instructions and if they find it helpful. Lastly, advertisement can be very annoying and interruptive when playing the game. I want to see if the user can spot the exit sign when an advertisement pops open and if that will distract them from the game. To test all of these, I made the survey questions with a set of instructions that guide the user step by step on how they should play the game and what features they should select in order to test the different metrics of the game. I also asked them for their satisfaction level and the difficulty in playing the game, all of which should help me understand what needs to entirely change in the application and what could be improved for a better user experience.

During the pilot test, I learned the frustrations a user can experience while using the app. As stated in the heuristic evaluation, the app seemed more suitable for expert gamers. This hypothesis was confirmed during the Usability Testing as the user had to rely on his instincts and was confused about how to play the game. The user also did not like the amount of advertisements the game forces a player to watch. While it is true that the game is free and advertisement is a way for the creators to earn income for their hard work, excessive advertisements only take away from the game as the user in this pilot testing was more than willing to exit the app and find another game. The instructions on how to play were also very hard to read as the screen automatically changes after 5 seconds or less. I believe that the game itself, once the user figured out how to play it, was entertaining, but all the poor design choices of not having a help button, save button, pause button and the excessive advertisements as previously discussed took away from the fun of the game. The pilot testing went well as the user spoke aloud every thought he had during the test. He told me what would have worked better during the test and what was helpful for him. I asked him if he had any questions about what we were doing and he asked me for clarification while conducting the test.

## User research [Contextual Inquiry]:
The main activity for this project is to see what makes the user download specific apps and what they look for while playing it so that I can build a game app for games that speak to the game's needs and desires. The basic need involved for this activity is a phone, a comfortable living room space of the user so that they feel relaxed while playing the game, and a phone where they can download the game. Traditionally, gamers have had to play a video game on devices such as Xbox or other similar devices where they are stuck in once place and do not have as much mobility due to the wires. With digital technology, they are able to play similar games to those on Xbox right on their phone. This means that they are no longer restricted on where to sit, but they have more mobility. The user must be from a game community. I prefer the user to have certain knowledge that would make them understand what they like or do not like in a game so that we understand what a game that speaks to the users’ needs looks like. The user would do the activity in their living room where they are comfortable and are able to play the game without being nervous or second guessing. Doing this activity in the living room will also tell us how a user is using a product in their own environment. The user will go to the application store where they will pick and download games they like on the phone that is provided to them. When I say phrases such as “show me,” or “tell me about,” the user will play the “Master” role and inform me on the game and its usability.

## Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation:
##### Wireframe:

These initial sketches demonstrate three key app features after the user signs up (or logs in if they don't have an account) in the game. After entering their username and password, the user can go to the homescreen where they can find the feature "How to Play" the game. They have the option to play the game after they are done reading the screen. The user can also choose their playlist. This gives them more freedom with their app and personalizes the game. Lastly, the user can Invite a Friend to play with them. This feature is especailly helpful for college student gamers who are looking for a way to connect with other individuals but are too shy to take part in college clubs.

The purpose of this low fidelity prototype is to see if the user can interact with the game application, "PianoTiltes4" by creating a paper protoype and testing it with another individual to see if they can follow the steps with ease or if there are further errors that need to be fixed. I have put together three personas, each of which cover a feature of the game. I have written an ideal situation with a goal for each persona, their needs, context, behavior, and stories. I have also included the wireframe flow of me doing it and one of the users testing it to see if they can follow my thought process.

## High-fidelity Prototype:
Piano Tiles 4 is a mobile app game designed to allow users to express freedom while playing the game. This idea is especially noticeable by the game giving users the choice to either invite their friends to play with them or play a solo game. This app also lets the user save their progress and choose difficulty levels, which helps ensure that the game can be played by beginners or expert gamers. The app is also designed to give the user sovereignty over their genre of playlist so that the user can relax or accommodate their current mood while playing the game. We hope that these choices not only help the user have fun in their free time but that it also helps them connect with their friends and find harmony through its composition.

### What I learned and changed from the feedback:

By reflecting the evaluation with others, I learned the different placement of navigation menu made it confusing for the user to act quickly as he had to search around the screen to see where main menu is. The user also pressed the quit game button when I asked him to go on the home screen. The new changes I have made to fix these issues are to move the “home” icon on the bottom of the screen along with the saved game and quit game button. I also labeled all three of these icons in order to ensure that the user is never confused about what these buttons do. The user seemed to seamlessly navigate around the menu otherwise and when I asked him to do the tasks (5 tasks: find how to play the game, choose difficulty level, choose playlist, invite friends, and save game) the user had no problem playing the game I intended it. With the new improvements I have made to the game, I am hopeful that the user will like playing the game even more seamlessly.

#### Changes After feedback:

##### Clear Placement of Icons/Features:

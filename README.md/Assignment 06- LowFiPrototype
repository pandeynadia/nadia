## A brief description of your project.
## A list of tasks that the paper prototype of your system supported.
## A set of pictures of the prototype in different states, showing it being tested.
## A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.

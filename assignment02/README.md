# DH 150 assignment02 Usability testing

## Purpose of UT, how & what I want to test especially based on the findings of heuristic evaluation

Usability Testing (UT) can inform the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction of the product – in this case, the Magic Piano Tiles 4 application. Based on the findings of heuristic evaluation, this app seems to assume that the user has a prior knowledge of how to play the game. Therefore, it is extremely important to see what a new user would look for, what may confuse them, and what they may like as a new user. All of this information is important in order to assess what to keep or change in the app. Additionally, the app gives a brief one sentence description about how to play the game. I want to find out if a new user is able to spot the “how to play” instructions and if they find it helpful. Lastly, advertisement can be very annoying and interruptive when playing the game. I want to see if the user can spot the exit sign when an advertisement pops open and if that will distract them from the game. To test all of these, I made the survey questions with a set of instructions that guide the user step by step on how they should play the game and what features they should select in order to test the different metrics of the game. I also asked them for their satisfaction level and the difficulty in playing the game, all of which should help me understand what needs to entirely change in the application and what could be improved for a better user experience.

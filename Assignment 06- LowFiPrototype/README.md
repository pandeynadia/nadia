# LowFiPrototype

# DH 150 Assignment06 by Nadia Pandey

## A brief description of the project:

This project intends to see if the user can interact with the game application, "PianoTiltes4" by creating a paper protoype and testing it with another individual to see if they can follow the steps with an ease or if there is further error that needs to be fixed. 

## A list of tasks that the paper prototype of the system supported. Note: While I have typed the tasks, it is also available in the photos below with a full bio and profile of personas:

## A video of the prototype in different states, showing it being tested:

## A description of what I would change or design differently based on the feedback I got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype:

### Prototype #1: Finding instructions on how to play the game:
### Prototype #2: Choosing your own songs/playlist
### Prototype #3: Invite a Friend

# LowFiPrototype

# DH 150 Assignment 06 by Nadia Pandey

## A brief description of the project:

This project intends to see if the user can interact with the game application, "PianoTiltes4" by creating a paper protoype and testing it with another individual to see if they can follow the steps with an ease or if there is further error that needs to be fixed. I have put together three personas, each of which cover a feature of the game. I have written an ideal situation with a goal for each persona, their needs, context, behavior, and stories. I have also included the wireframe flow of me doing it and one of the user testing it to see if they can follow my thought process.

## A list of tasks that the paper prototype of the system supported. Note: I have typed the tasks of each prototype below, and added the photos below with a full bio and profile of personas, along with wireframes/wireflow:

### Tasks for Prototype #1: Finding instructions on how to play the game:
1. Enter username and password.
2. Click on How to Play.
3. After reading the instructions, press Done.
4. Play the Game.
5. Save the Game.

### Tasks for Prototype #2: Choosing your own songs/playlist
1. After entering username and password, choose a song.
2. Click on one of the Playlist that you want to sync.
3. Select All of the songs.
4. Click Sync button.
5. Play the Game.

### Tasks for Prototype #3: Invite a Friend
1. After entering username and password, Invite a friend to play the game.
2. Play Live Mode.
3. Enter Friend's Code.
4. Click on Play Live Mode.
5. Play the Game.
6. Save the Game.

## A description of what I would change or design differently based on the feedback I got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype:

### Prototype #1: Finding instructions on how to play the game:
For this prototype, the tester hesitated to follow the screen order because I drew the wireframes in the order of left to right for the first three and then right to left for the last two. In the future, I would draw the wireframes from left to right as most of us automatically learn to read this way therefore, it can be confusing if the user is forced to follow the screen the opposite way.

### Prototype #2: Choosing your own songs/playlist:
For this protoype, the tester did not know what the "No" button on the All songs synced page of the app did. In the furuter, I will make sure to write on the button "Go Back" instead of "No" so that the user knows that the button can take them back to the previous screen. I would also insert "Back" button on every page for consistency and easiness for the user.

### Prototype #3: Invite a Friend:
For this prototype, the tester was confused on the Live Mode screen where they did not fully understand the instruction and thought that the "Enter Friend's Code" button was actually a place for them to enter their own code and not the friends. The instructions on the wireframe may have been hard to read. In the future, I will write clearer instructions so that the tester can understand excatly what each button means.

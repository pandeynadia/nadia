# LowFiPrototype

# DH 150 Assignment 06 by Nadia Pandey

## A brief description of the project:

This project intends to see if the user can interact with the game application, "PianoTiltes4" by creating a paper protoype and testing it with another individual to see if they can follow the steps with an ease or if there is further error that needs to be fixed. I have put together three personas, each of which cover a feature of the game. I have written an ideal situation with a goal for each persona, their needs, context, behavior, and stories. I have also included the wireframe flow of me doing it and one of the user testing it to see if they can follow my thought process.

## A list of tasks that the paper prototype of the system supported. Note: I have typed the tasks of each prototype below, and added the photos below with a full bio and profile of personas, along with wireframes/wireflow:

### Prototype #1: Finding instructions on how to play the game:
### Prototype #2: Choosing your own songs/playlist
### Prototype #3: Invite a Friend

## A video of the prototype in different states, showing it being tested:

## A description of what I would change or design differently based on the feedback I got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype:

### Prototype #1: Finding instructions on how to play the game:
### Prototype #2: Choosing your own songs/playlist
### Prototype #3: Invite a Friend
